				<h2><span>Biryani</span></h2>
				<p>A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the effort. Long-grained rice flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered with chicken, fish, lamb or vegetables and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special dish.</p>
